The flow parts:

Configure
Run
Control

Debug is crucial task

yamllint -- check syntax, indents, etc. in yaml files
yq -- lightweight command line yaml processor (incl. merge)


handoff and autopopulation...
in most cases it's mistake to invent own syntax


we have:
 1. YAML _description_ of settings
 2. YAML _configuration_ of the project/block/etc. --- we should check against description
 3. YAML _description_ of the flow steps
 4. TCL description on how to generate flat scripts --- we should probably check against flow steps desctiption

somehow it's needed to combine population of the tool specific screepts and scheduler to run this scripts
